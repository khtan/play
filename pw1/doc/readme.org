* Intent
Sometimes Playwright fails for unknown reasons and it is good to have a simple set of canonical tests that work
off the bat. This is the set that Playwright's Getting Started page provides.

However, some of the defaults are for the interactive user rather than production user.

This repo captures some of the minor changes :

1. Add testMatch to configuration file so that .spec.ts and .e2e-spec.ts are valid tess.
   This allows the distinction between pure non Gui tests and Gui tests.

2. The reporter html output is changed to list so that it is easier to record/compare runs.

3. package.json is updated with test:hello and test:demo so that the provided tests have 
   a simple npm run interface.
   The folder doc contains a working run for both npm run test:hello and npm run test:example
