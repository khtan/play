** motivation
The idea is to have one repo for all places to try things etc
** registry
| machine      | os    | directory                |
|--------------+-------+--------------------------|
| air-win10    | win10 | c:\cprojects\github\play |
| kwee1-ubuntu | wsl2  | ~/cprojects/github/play  |
| kwee1-win10  | win10 | d:/cprojects/github/play |
|              |       |                          |
** github password ( do not put here )
A minor change to test push again from air
->air remembers
A minor change to test push from kwee1 win10
Second minor change to confirm password is remembered on kwee1 win10
-> kwee1 win10 remembers
A minor change to test push from kwee1 ubuntu
Second minor change on kwee1 ubuntu to see if remembered
-> kwee1 ubuntu does not remember
Maybe some setup not yet done
Does not bring up the github dialog

Installed git-credential-manager
4th change added
kwee1 ubuntu did not remember
5th change added
kwee1 ubuntu did not remember

So the git-credential-manger is not completely working

Failure is due to 
net::ERR_ABORTED HEAD https://www.driveway.com/_next/data/auksaRstBdYcp9cFKE2Se/index.json?code=fTpes1uugALz8_B9xUdBJom15IXVgTbM6z2cHB5VNTKxl&state=_NiRDcqbv6ug80zgdc_q74tMhDI3%7EaMb

*** options
1. increase timeout value
2. write a loop that increases the timeout and retests

0. Each function ( login, logout ) needs a verifying line
