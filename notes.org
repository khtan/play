The idea is to have one repo for all places to try things etc
** registry
| machine      | os    | directory                |
|--------------+-------+--------------------------|
| air-win10    | win10 | c:\cprojects\github\play |
| kwee1-ubuntu | wsl2  | ~/cprojects/github/play  |
| kwee1-win10  | win10 | d:/cprojects/github/play |
|              |       |                          |
** github password ( do not put here )
A minor change to test push again from air
